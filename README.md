# A library of modern FORTRAN modules.

I started in 1979 with a small set of basic FORTRAN helper functions written in FORTRAN IV.
These were mainly to make homework assignments easier.
In 1982 I extended the library significantly while programming on a PDP-11/34 in FORTRAN 77.
After the Army I went back to college. From 1989-1991 the library was again extended while I was doing my
undergrad research, this time on a VAX 8700 and Cray Y-MP.
The next major evolution occurred in 1993 during my first graduate work on stellar evolution.
Building star models on a Sun Sparc 20.
I picked back up in 1996 and from 96 through 2000 I tinkered off an on with the library.
In 2015 a major evolution occurred with the complete rewrite in FORTRAN 2003.
Finally? at the end of 2019 the library is being brought up to full 2018 compliance,
with all deprecated features removed. This is a work in progress,
a little more than half of the 2015 library is here in this repository.
